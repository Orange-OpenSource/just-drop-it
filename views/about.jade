                h5 Why
                p "Just drop it" allows you to simply and instantly send a file to a colleague, whatever your network configuration (VPN, etc...).
                p We thought that this kind of tool was missing in our work environment, so we tried to set one up. Lucky for us, tools like Nodejs, Boost and Kermit made it quite easy to get something up and running.
                h5 Recipe
                p nodejs + express + socket-io + boost(bootstrap)...
                h5 Source code
                p We hope to publish it on Orange Github repository.
