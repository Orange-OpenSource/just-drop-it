    h5 UI evolution
    p Migration to boosted 4 and redesign of the UI... You saw it, right?
    h5 User friendly url generation
    p More readable, but it is random. We are not responsible if you get some nasty word associations!
    h5 Increased transfer speed
    p By handling sending process in web workers we increased transfer speed (especially when using chrome with a background tab)
    h5 Error on http disconnections
    p Sometimes http connections are force closed (by a proxy for instance) when lasting too long. We haven't figured any solution for that yet, but at least we will warn you if it happens.
    h5 Multi-send support
    p You are now able to send a file to multiple recipients at the same time. The generated link will work as long as you don't close your browser.
    h5 IE support on reception
    p Your friends suffering from Internet Explorer addiction will be able to <b>receive</b> files (not to send, we are not that nice).
    h5 Open Source
    p Our project is now hosted on&nbsp;
