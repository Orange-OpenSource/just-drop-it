# Just Drop It

just-drop-it allows you to simply and instantly send a file to a friend, whatever your network configuration (proxies, VPN, and such). Just open your browser, drop the file in it and send the generated link to your friendÂ : the file will be beamed to him without being stored on any platform.

### why would anyone do this?
We thought that this kind of tool was missing in our work environment, so we tried to set one up. Lucky for us, tools like [node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [socket.IO](http://socket.io/) and [socket.IO-stream](https://github.com/nkzawa/socket.io-stream) made it quite easy to get something up and running.

## How to use it
It couldn't be more simple (but you will need a running  instance of just-drop-it. If you don't have one see [the section below](##how-to-run-it) or wait for our online demo (*if a few days, we promise* :grin:)

- open your just-drop-it in your browser 
- drop your file (*just one please*)

- send the generated link to your friends

- **keep your browser open** until your friends received the complete file

## How to run it

### on any computer
You will need both [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you want to run it.

* Download the source code
* run `npm install` to download the needed dependencies 
* `node server.js` will start node-js server

### on an openshift instance
just-drop-it should work on [openshift] (http://openshift.redhat.com/) instances. Juste create a node-js 0.10 app and synchronize its git repository with our.

## From a technical point of view
More details on our implementation, to be updated.

### Framework
To meet the requirements, we chose the followings:

- [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
- [socket.io](http://socket.io/): this allows us communication between clients and server.
- [socket.io stream](https://github.com/nkzawa/socket.io-stream): this allows us to stream the file between sender and server.

### Error handling
Handling network cutting is a hassle. The most common scenario is the following:

- a big file transfer is ongoing
- one of the proxies cut the transfer connection
- Not only neither the server nor the receiver are notified that the transfer failed, but also will the download in browser be let in a *success* state, even if all the file size was not received.

In order to provide a better monitoring, the number of bytes written on the http download socket are monitored, allowing us to:

- provide real download progress
- close a transfer that has been closed by the network
- control that when a socket is closed, all the file size bytes has been written on it
